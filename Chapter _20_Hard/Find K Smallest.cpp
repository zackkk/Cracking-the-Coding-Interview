/* Describe an algorithm to find the largest 1 million numbers in 1 billion numbers. 
   Assume that the computer memory can hold all one billion numbers.*/

// Solution 1: sort, O(nlogn)

// Solution 2: min-heap, O(nlogm)

// Solution 3: selection rank algorithm, idea comes from pivot in quick sort, expected O(n)
